# bikesharing

## Background and Overview

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary

Based on the visualions performed for this analysis we can surmise that for New York City:
- Bikesharing stalls located in heavily concentrated business areas, such as Downtown and Midtown, made up the majority of bike usage.
- Subscribers were the primary/majority users
- Male riders were the higest user
- The duration of most trips was under 10 minutes
- Weekday AM and PM rush hours were the most utilized times, followed by afternoons on the weekends.
- One off customers utilized the bike share program on weekends
- Subscribers utilized during the weekdays

In summary, while the data from NYC does suggest a postive cost benefit analysis of use in heavily populated downtown areas, more analysis is needed of similar city size to Des Moines, IA.  New York City is a densely populated that is vastly bigger then that of Des Moines, IA.  There are other differences, such as NYC having a thriving public transportation infrastructure and lack of parking.  Whereas Des Moines, IA has a very different transportation infrastructure.

Other suggestions for further analysis:
- Year round weather analysis for seasonal usage 
- Reviewing data from other smaller cities with similar transportation infrastructure
- Reviewing data from other smaller cities with similar population size and traffic patterns
